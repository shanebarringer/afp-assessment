## Description & Usage

A simple CLI that takes a start time, along with minutes to be added, and returns the new time.
**For example, providing a start time of "11:15 AM" and total minutes of 65, should result in a new time of "12:20 PM"**

### Working with the CLI

The CLI accepts (and requires) two inputs:

- `--time`, `-t` - the starting time, in the following format: "10:15 AM"
- `--minutes`, `-m` - the number of minutes to add to the start time

_note: for a full description of usage, please use the `-h` flag_

#### Running the CLI

The CLI itself can be run via the `start` command, or as an executable:

- `npm start -- -t="11:15 AM" -m=55`
- `add-minutes -t="11:15 AM" -m=55`

### Tests & Coverage

Tests can be run with `npm test`.

Additionally a coverage report can be generated by installing jest globally `npm i -g jest`,and running `jest --coverage .`

### TODO

- error handling for CLI input
- style terminal output
