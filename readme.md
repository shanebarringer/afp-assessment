## Description & Usage

A simple CLI that takes a start time, along with minutes to be added, and returns the new time.  **For example, providing a start time of "11:15 AM" and total minutes of 65, should result in a new time of "12:20 PM"**



### Working with the CLI

The CLI accepts (and requires) two inputs: 

- `--time`, `-t`  - the starting time, in the following format: "10:15 AM"
- `--minutes`, `-m` - the number of minutes to add to the start time

_note: for a full description, please use the `-h` flag_



### Tests & Coverage

Tests can be run with `npm test`.

Additionally a coverage report can be generated by installing jest globally `npm i -g jest`, and running `jest --coverage .`



### TODO

- error handling for CLI input
- style terminal output
